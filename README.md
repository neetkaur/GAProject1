Memory Game on Grid

Description:
This game will first show a grid with different colors randomly placed. The grid will then go blank, the user is now expected to put the colors in the right place on the grid. There will be a timer that makes note of how long it takes for the user to complete the game. If user does not complete it in assigned time then they lose.
In a 2 user game , the one who solves it in lesser time wins.
The second user here could be another user or just the computer , in case of computer, it would randomly choose places since AI logic is not incorporated here.
